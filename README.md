## Getting started

Run the following command to clone the starter

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victorkangsh/yoga2-jwt.git
```

Then `cd` and change `.env` file and `Dockerfile env`

Once this is done, run

```bash
yarn install
yarn deploy
```

For a quicker startup, choose `Demo server`

```bash
? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server?
  Use existing database      Connect to existing database
  Create new database        Set up a local database using Docker

  Or deploy to an existing Prisma server:
❯ Demo server                Hosted demo environment incl. database
```

You're good to go, simply run `yarn dev` and the server will start 🙌
